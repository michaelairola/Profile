      Believe it or not, this website you are on is being served to you through a very small (but efficient)
      computer located in the corner of my living room. For those of you who don't know the power of what a
      <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/about/">Raspberry Pi</a> is capable of, check out all these cool things that people around the world
      have been able to accomplish by using this <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Raspberry-Pi-RASPBERRYPI3-MODB-1GB-Model-Motherboard/dp/B01CD5VC92">amazingly cheap</a> $15 computer chip!

  <h1>What the hell is a server?</h1>
  <div class="article">
    <p>
      If you are reading about servers, I'm going to assume you're old enough to not be offended by swear words.
      Most people know very little about servers, yet they are the foundational building blocks to the Internet
      as we know it. If you have plenty of knowledge and understanding of what servers are, good for you.
      <a href="#build_your_own">Continue to the next section</a> if you want to learn how to build your own! For the rest of
      us, I'm going to start with the basics: What the hell is a server?
    </p>
    <p>
      A server is a computer set up to interact with other computers by
      sending and recieving data. When the computer sends data to another computer, it is said to be "serving" the data (hence the name). When the
      computer is recieving data from another computer, we call the message that is recieved a "request".
    </p>
    <p>
      Let's look at the classic browsing-the-web scenario; You know, the thing you were probably doing about 5 minutes ago?
      When you click a link, your computer sends a request to the server associated with the url of that link. From here,
      the server will send data to your computer, typically in the form of an html file, for your
      browser to read and interpret into the website you see! Pretty neat stuff right?
    </p>
    <p>
      Now before you say "Wow that's so simple! Why does <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Server_(computing)">Wikipedia</a> make it sound so complicated?"
      I have to tell you that this is a very basic (yet common) example of what a server does. Servers can also
      send and recieve e-mail (known as e-mail servers), send and recieve files (file servers) and do many other things
      as long as the proper server-software is installed on the computer. The example above
      focuses on Hyper Text Transfer Protocol (HTTP) servers, because
      hypertext is the type of data that browsers read and convert into websites! So there you have it,
      the basics of what a server is!

    <p>
      There are many resources out there that can help you if you want to build your
      own server. A couple of really good resources that will lead you in the right direction are
      the following:

      <li>
        <a href="https://maker.pro/raspberry-pi/projects/raspberry-pi-web-server">raspberrypi.org</a>

      </li>
    </p>
    <p>
      Depending on what configurations you want and how familiar you are with the hardware
      of raspberry pi's, you should search through these tutorials and find the right one for you.
      Otherwise, happy hacking and good luck!
